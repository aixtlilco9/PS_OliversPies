# PS_OliversPies
a .netcore web app that I completed from plural sight to familiarize
myself with .netcore and further my familiarity with the MVC design pattern. 
I worked on this through visual studio 2017 and used VSTS as opposed to github to keep track 
of the changes in my code but have now added it to my github through git-bash.

initially after having fixed the login problem the first time I went on to try to get the 
site running on azure, so i could have some sort of work to show when applying for jobs,
and I managed to somewhat get it up but it would quickly after crash as there was something wrong with the database perhaps I
didnt set the connection string right or copy it properly point is it didnt work.
my azure free trial later ran out and i could no longer play around with it as I needed the sql server which is not free...

I made a recording of how it looks like when it runs and the results of some of the request however the file is to "large" to include in here.
